# Billing

## Backup
The billing for Backup is calculated by GB of data stored in the service
after deduplication per month. By signing up for contracts for a certain period (12 months or 36 months) the cost will be lower. See our [pricing page][pp].

## Compute
Cost for instances running in the Compute platform has the following components:

* Number of hours an instance was in active mode, the past month.
* The amount of used disk space used by the instance. Please note that any instance started in the platform will have a root filesystem volume (40 GB fast storage if not manually created) that will be billed unless the instance is completely deleted.
* The amount of disk based used by manually created volumes. This applies to all existing volumes regardless if they are connected to an instance or not.

## Storage
The cost for Storage is calculated by GB of data stored in the service. By signing up for contracts for a certain period (12 months or 36 months) the cost will be lower. See our [pricing page][pp].
