# IPnett Cloud BaaS API

IPnett has deployed a public API that can be used to automate TSM client (node) management. The API is implemented as a RESTful API, accessible via `https://api.cloud.ipnett.se/`. Usage examples can be found in https://github.com/IPnett/cloud-BaaS/blob/master/API.md.

API access credentials are created out of band via the IPnett Cloud Service Portal.
