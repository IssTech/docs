## How to get support

All out customers can e-mail support@safespring.com for all the services.

!!! info
    The older *@cloud.ipnett-support e-mail addresses will continue to work,
    but we are moving away from them, so please direct all questions and
    reports to support@safespring.com.

If you report issues with our services, please include as much information as
possible as this will make it easier for our engineers to start trouble
shooting. Relevant information could be instance IDs for compute instances, logs
from the backup client etc.

Also refer to our [policy](../policies) for important information about our SLA and
support level.
