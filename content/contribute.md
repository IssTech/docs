## Fast GitHub-based workflow

For quick, small changes - like fixing a typo or rewording something - the
easiest way to contribute is directly on GitHub!

1. Click the pencil to the right of the header on the page. This will open the
   page in GitHub's online editor.

1. Edit the contents, describe your changes and click on the *Propose file
   change* button.

1. GitHub will now create a branch and a commit for your changes (forking the
   repository first if this is your first contribution) and it will also
   display a preview of your changes. If everything is correct, click on the
   *Create pull request* button.

1. GitHub will display a new page where you can do some last-minute changes to
   your pull request before creating it. For simple contributions, you can
   safely ignore these options and just click on the *Create pull request*
   button again.

This creates a pull request and will notify Safespring to review it, possibly
suggesting further tweaks or edits. Thank you very much :-)
