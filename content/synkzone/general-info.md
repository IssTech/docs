# General info

## What is Synkzone?
1. Synkzone is a truly secure storage and sharing service for files, built for business and other professional organizations.
2. Synkzone combines in a unique way the flexibility, availability and simplicity of cloud storage with the control that traditional file servers provide. Synkzone can function both as a complete file management solution, and as a complement to manage individual projects.
3. Synkzone has a number of unique features that distinguish it from other similar services:
    31. **Full control** — In Synkzone, you have, in contrast to most other cloud storage services, full control over your files and user accounts; where files are stored and who has access to them. Our security solution is based on "zero knowledge", which means that neither we as a provider of Synkzone or any third party have access to either the file content or encryption keys. This makes Synkzone different from most other similar solutions. Our zone concept, where one or more people can work with shared files, provides easy access and adapts to the organization and workflows.
    32. **Intelligent File Synchronization** — Our unique synchronization technology ensures that you always have access to the files you need. This without having to carry with you a large amount of storage space, without the hassle of special security solutions like VPN, and even when you have no network connection. So Synkzone is a good solution not only in the office, but also for mobile users.
    33. **Internal and external cooperation aid** — Synkzone has a unique combination of automatic logging and a system to freely send messages in chat form within a workgroup that allows users to see who is doing what. An easy to use version control also means that errors can be easily corrected (and also provides effective protection against threats such as ransomware). Synkzone support easy and secure collaboration with external partners or customers.
4. Every company or organization has its own Synkzone service that is completely disconnected from other organizations, providing extra security.
5. All within an organization that will use the Synkzone need an account that can only be created by one or more Synkzone administrators appointed by the organization itself. Learn more in How can I create a new account? and How can I become a Synkzone administrator for my organization?.
6. To use Synkzone, you also need to install the program Synker on your computer. Read more about this in [What is Synker?][What is Synker?].
7. All work in Synkzone then takes place in different zones, which you can read more about in [What is a zone?][What is a zone?].
8. See [How do I get started with Synkzone?][How do I get started with Synkzone?] for more information about how to get started with using Synkzone.

## What is Synker?

1. Synker is a program that runs on a standard PC and provides full access to the Synkzone service.
2. Synker keeps, among other things, local files synchronized with the content of one or more zones. Read more about zones under [What is a zone?][What is a zone?].
3. Normally Synker starts automatically in the background and appears as an icon in your computer's taskbar, but Synker also provides a user interface that provides access to specific features Synkzone.

## How do I get started with Synkzone?

1. First of all, order an [organization account from Safespring here](https://www.safespring.com/tjanster/order-synkzone/). It should normally have the same name as your organization's domain name (as in www.domain or user@domain), which makes it possible for usernames in your organization to be the same as email addresses. This is however not an absolute requirement, although the organization name needs to be unique and cannot infringe on any trade mark owned by someone else. For individual project, we normally want to assign a name that consists of the project name (or acronym) followed by “.proj” or something similar. Synkzone reserves the right to deny the use of an organization name, but tries to fulfill your wishes as far as possible.
2. Once your Synkzone organization is set up, you get the login information for the Main administrator account (admin@organization) from Synkzone. It is then the only account in the organization except for a special group account (which you cannot log on to). This admin account has unique privileges that no other user in the organization can have, and should only be made available to one or a few trusted employees.
3. From Synkzone, you also get an installer for the Synker client. Install Synker on the computer that is normally used by the Main administrator in your organization.
4. When you start Synker first time, you get some questions about the license and basic settings. Normally you can keep all the suggested default settings for now.
5. Then you can log on using the Main administrator account. Depending on who may have access to the computer, and depending on your organization's general security policies, you can choose to save your password on the computer. However, we recommend not saving the password for the Main administrator on any computer.
6. Once you are logged on as Main administrator, you should first of all change the password (see [How do I change my password?][How do I change my password?]) to a new secure password. This is
because the initial password for the admin account can otherwise be known by third parties know or got over the initial login credentials when you got them from the Synkzone.
7. It is very important that you save the password for the admin account in one or more very safe places, because the admin account gives full control over the Synkzone service for your organization, and Synkzone’s fundamental security makes it very difficult to recreate this account.
8. You should also double-click the user account in the Users list and enter a valid email address to be associated with the Main administrator account. This email address is important to be able to provide some assistance to users in the organization, and also as a possible contact address for important notifications from Synkzone.
9. Then everything is ready to start creating zones (see [How do I create a new zone?][How do I create a new zone?]), user accounts (see [How can I create a new account?][How can I create a new account?]), and add users to the zones (see [How do I add a user to a zone?][How do I add a user to a zone?]).
10. Overviews of all users and all zones are always available in the Overview tab.
11. To begin with, there is always a first zone created along with the organization that has the same name as the organization. It can be used as a place for sharing information throughout the organization, and it may be appropriate to give the group account (All at organization) access rights to that zone. It is also possible to change the name of the zone if desired (open zone tab, and select Properties from the Zone menu), or delete zone completely (select Leave from the Zone menu).
12. We recommend that you as Main administrator create on or more user accounts that you give administrator privileges, which can be used by selected trusted persons in your organization. These privileges can only be given by the Main administrator, and give the user the right to create new user accounts and zones. This means that the extra sensitive Main administrator account does not have to be used in normal daily business.
